# JSL08: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management
# Introduction
The task was to create a function with the Singleton Pattern.to implement the Singleton Pattern for managing a single instance of the `BankBranch` class throughout the application, ensuring that multiple instances refer to the same object.

# Elements Included
Variable declarations, modal management, form submission, event listeners, input validation, form input clearing, and modal closure.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Conditional Logic:** I believe that I was able to demonstrate that fallback value assignment and input validation are two uses for conditional statements.
**Event Handling:** Using event listeners to manage form submission and intended modal closing.

# Challenges Faced
The possiblity of errors and incomplete code made debugging difficult. Error handling for other possiblle problems (such as invalid DOM element references) is absent, input validation is implemented for `studentName` and `personalMessage` 

# Overall Learning Experience
Through an understanding of event listener behaviour and event-driven programming, this project improved my comprehension of an event flow.
