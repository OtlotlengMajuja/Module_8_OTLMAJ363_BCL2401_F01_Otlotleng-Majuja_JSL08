# JSL08: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management
# Introduction
The assignment was to use the Singleton Pattern to develop a function to ensure that various instances of the `BankBranch` class refer to the same onject by implementing the Singleton Pattern, ehich manages a single instanceof the class throughout the application.

# Elements Included
Variable declarations, class declaration, constructor, method definition, and singleton pattern implementation.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Class and Constructor Usage:** I believe that by defining the (`BankBranch`) class and the use of its constructor to initialize instances serves as examples of JavaScript class and constructor proficiency.
**Instance Methods:** Defined and worked with class instances using instance methods(`getBranchinfo`).

# Challenges Faced
Having to deal with the variable scope and understand the context (`this`) keyword within classes and methods lead to a few errors, however I was able to handle and properly understand the context by the end of the project. 

# Overall Learning Experience
Understanding design patterns, such as the singleton pattern, aided in my comprehension of fundamental programming ideas, such as instance management and encapsulation. the practical application through creating the Singleton instance improved my coding skills.
